<h2>What is java?</h2>

Java is one of the most popular languages in the coding world! It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
It is used for:
* Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
* Desktop applications
* Web applications
* Web servers and application servers
* Games
* Database connection
* And much, much more!

<h2>Why Use Java?</h2>

* Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
* It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
* It is easy to learn and simple to use
* It is open-source and free
* It is secure, fast and powerful
* It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
* Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

<h3>Getting Started </h3>

We will be using JDoodle online compiler to learn coding in java. You donâ€™t have to install anything on your system.

<h3>Hello World</h3>

System.out.println() is used to print something on the computer screen.

Write the following code in the Jdoodle compiler and press execute.

Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code above.
The output should be:

Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Java program.

<h4>Java Syntax</h4>

Syntax basically means the correct structure to write code in Java.

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
The name of the java file must match the class name.

<h4> The main method </h4>

The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

<p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while learning Java.</p>
For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

<h4> System.out.println() </h4>

Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.
You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
